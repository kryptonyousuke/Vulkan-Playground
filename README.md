# Vulkan-Playground
I will be using this repository to learn raw vulkan, vulkan frameworks, rust and useful tools I found navigating on the internet.

## What you need to know
- Vulkan parts are mostly in [src/OhMyVulkan](src/OhMyVulkan).
- Most part of the projects are in [src/playground](src/playground) folder.
- That's not a professional project.
- The code can be a trash, that's intentional.
- I'm usually optimazing the code for performance, but it's not a rule.
- Unstable technologies will be added here, and this code is not made by an specialist, so **use this code at your own risk.**
- I'm not organizated.
